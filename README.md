# Rexiel's NvChad Config

A simple Nvchad custom config designed to setup lspconfig with rust_analyzer.
Should prolly work out of the box after mason installs rust_analyzer.

I have migrated to using [nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim) you can find my nixified config here [Rexcrazy804/nixvim-config](https://github.com/Rexcrazy804/nixvim-config)
